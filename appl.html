        <div> <h2> Stage 0 </h2>
          <h3> Lesson 1: Basics of the Web and HTML</h3>
          <div>
           <b>Browsers,Internet, Servers and HTTP</b><br>
            HTML: Hypertext Markup Language <br>
            Text Content = or what you see<br>
            Markup = or what it looks like<br>
            References to other documents = Videos &amp; Images<br>
            Links to other Pages<br><br>
            HTML Markup <br>  
            Multiple Tag descriptions<br>
            How tags are structured and using them. Closing tag has /<br>
            So you have opening and closing tags<br><br>
            </div>
            <div>
            <b> Bold tags are cool </b><br>
            <em>Italic tags are even better</em><br>
            <em>Then you have the issues of no closing tag as in this example where the italics never end......<br><br></em>
            </div>
            <b> HTML Attributes</b><br>
            Anchor Tag "a"<br>
            <br>
            </div>
            <div>  
            <b>Images</b> <br>
          </div>
           You may be wondering why anchor tags use the href attribute while img tags use the src attribute. And you may become frustrated when (not if) you make the mistake of using one when you really need the other. Because when you make this mistake, your HTML will not work.
           So how will you ever remember details like this?    
           Well... you don't have to!
           In fact, you may have already forgotten how to add links to HTML. That's fine. Unless you're writing HTML all the time, details like these aren't worth remembering. A Google search for "adding links in html" will always get you your answer.
           New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts.
           But programming doesn't work like that! There's just too  many facts to remember them all.
           Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them.
           So continue with this lesson and don't worry about remembering everything. At the end of the lesson, we'll do a recap of what is  important.<br>
           <br>
           <b> Bold Tags</b> <br> <b>Span and Div</b><br><br>
           That's right! a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements while div, p, and form are block elements.<br> <br>
          <b> HTML Documents</b><br><br>
      <h3> Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>
      <br>
      <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b>
     <br><br>
        HTML files are the <b>"Structure"</b><br>
        CSS Files are the <b>"Style"</b><br>
        JavaScript are the <b>"Interactive Files"</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>The House</b><br>
        Compare a website to a house, HTML is the structure (where the walls are placed, etc), CSS is the style (what color are the walls, etc),
        and Java Script is the interactive components (TV remote, CD Player, Dishwasher etc.)
        <br>
        <b>Boxes, Boxes Everywhere</b>
        Everything you see on a webpage can be broken down into boxes. Image te possibilities.
        What is in those boxes is whatever you put in them and can be altered with CSS "style"  or JavaScript "interactive" etc.....

     <h2> Stage 1 </h2>
     <h3> Adding CSS and Structure</h3>
     CSS-Cascading Style Sheets<br><br>
     *You can select by class<br>
     <b>.description{attribute: Value;}</b><br>
     Example
     *You can combine selectors as well.<br><br>
     CSS Code is written to control the "Style" of the HTML Element<br>
     <h3> Adding Style</h3>
     There are a few ways to add Style to your HTML.<br><br>
     1. You can link your style.css file to your HTML file. <br>
     2. You can include it in the 'head' of your HTML.<br>
     3. You can write your style in line with the HTML (bad idea)<br>
     <h3> The Box Model</h3><br>
     <b> Margins, Borders, Padding and Content</b><br>
      Content- Has text or image or whatever.<br>
      Padding- Clears and aarea around the content and protects it.<br>
      Border- Area around Padding and Content<br>
      Margin- Clears an area around the Border.<br><br>
      <h3> Flex Box</h3>
      <b> display: flex;</b>
      <br>
      I wish I could explain it but I think I understand what it does. Played with it for a while.<br>
      <h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>
      1. Look for Natrual Boxes<br>  
      2. Look for Repeated Style and Symantic Elements.<br>
      3. Write Your HTML<br>
      4. Apply Styles (from BIGGEST to Smallest)<br>
      5. Fix Things
